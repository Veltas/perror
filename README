To install, run from the root repo directory (as root):

# make install

Also provides targets 'all', 'clean', 'uninstall' as expected, see
'Makefile' for details.

Immediately after running programs with errno.h-based exit codes,
typically you would run:

$ perror $?

Which would output the associated error message for that code.

perror expects a single argument, the error number. It can also take
the option --help or -h to print basic usage info.
